## Overview

This project covers the implementation and analysis of several key graph algorithms and a machine learning algorithm. The objective is to understand the underlying concepts and apply them to real-world problems. The algorithms implemented in this work include:

- Prim's Algorithm - A greedy algorithm used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a graph.

- Kruskal's Algorithm - Another algorithm for finding the MST by using a disjoint-set data structure.

- Bellman-Ford Algorithm - A shortest-path algorithm capable of handling negative weight edges and detecting negative weight cycles.

- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm - A dynamic programming algorithm used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a graph.

- Decision Tree Classifier - A supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks by splitting data based on feature values.
